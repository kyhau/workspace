## Privilege Escalation

```
# On the system, search for all SUID files
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

## Burp Suite

Burp Suite is one of those tools that is very useful to have around, whether you're explicitly assessing a web or mobile application for a pentest/bug bounty, or are simply wanting to debug a new feature in a web app you are developing.

## GoBuster
Locating directories

https://github.com/OJ/gobuster

Gobuster is a tool used to brute-force:
- URIs (directories and files) in web sites.
- DNS subdomains (with wildcard support).
- Virtual Host names on target web servers.
- Open Amazon S3 buckets

```bash
sudo apt-get install gobuster

# Now lets run GoBuster with a wordlist: e.g. /usr/share/wordlists
gobuster dir -u http://<ip>:3333 -w <word list location>


# -e	Print the full URLs in your console
# -u	The target URL
# -w	Path to your wordlist
# -U and -P	Username and Password for Basic Auth
# -p <x>	Proxy to use for requests
# -c <http cookies>	Specify a cookie for simulating your auth

```

## Metasploit
Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.

https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework

Main components of the Metasploit Framework:

- `msfconsole`: The main CLI.
- Modules: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
- Tools: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing.

## Nmap
Nmap is short for Network Mapper. It is an open-source Linux command-line tool that is used to scan IP addresses and ports in a network and to detect installed applications.

```bash
# Scan this machine
# Attempts to determine the version of the services running
nmap -sV <machines ip>

# What is the most likely operating system this machine is running?
nmap -O <machines ip>

# Port scan for port <x> or scan all ports
-p <x> or -p-
# Disable host discovery and just scan for open ports
-Pn
# Enables OS and version detection, executes in-build scripts for further enumeration
-A
# Scan with the default nmap scripts
-sC
# Verbose mode
-v
# UDP port scan
-sU

# TCP SYN port scan
-sS
```
