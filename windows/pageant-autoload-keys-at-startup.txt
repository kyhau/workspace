To make Pageant automatically run and load keys at startup:

- Find the location of pageant.exe

- Windows key + R to open the 'run' dialog box

- Type: 'shell:startup' in the dialog box

- Create a shortcut to the pageant.exe and put into this startup folder.

- Right click on the shortcut and open 'Properties'

- In 'Target' add: "<path to>/pageant.exe" --encrypted myprivatekeyname.ppk

- In 'Start in' add: "<path to myprivatekeyname.ppk>"

- Click on the shortcut link and check that Pageant has started and has loaded your keys
