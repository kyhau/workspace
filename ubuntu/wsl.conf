# Setting to false means they wonâ€™t be mounted automatically but you could still mount them manually or via fstab.

# Setting to true causes the file /etc/fstab to be processed on WSL start.
# /etc/fstab is a file where you can declare other filesystems, like an SMB share.
# Thus, you can mount these filesystems automatically in WSL on start up.
